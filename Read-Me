# Time Series Analysis of JPMC Stock Prices: ARIMA vs. LSTM

This project focuses on performing a comparative analysis of two popular time series forecasting techniques, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), using JPMC (JPMorgan Chase & Co.) stock prices as the dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to forecast the future stock prices of JPMC by applying both the ARIMA and LSTM models to historical stock price data. The project is divided into the following sections:

1. Data Collection: Obtaining historical JPMC stock price data from reliable sources.
2. ARIMA Modeling: Building an ARIMA model to forecast stock prices and evaluating its performance.
3. LSTM Modeling: Implementing an LSTM model for stock price prediction and comparing it with the ARIMA model.
4. Results and Conclusion: Analyzing the performance of both models and drawing conclusions.
